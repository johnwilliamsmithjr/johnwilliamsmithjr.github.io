	<h1>Greetings everyone, I'm John Smith!</h1>
	<p>I am currently an assistant professor in the Department of Mathematical Sciences at Montana State University. My doctoral research (completed May 2022) was focused on Bayesian state-space modeling for ecosystem models. More broadly, my research interests are about modeling, forecasting, and simulation of complex dynamical systems, especially applications in ecology. <a href="/about">Read more about me here...</a></p>
