<h2>Talk 1: Christian Stratton</h2>
	<p>Abstract: In response to the spread of White-nose syndrome (WNS) and SARS-CoV-2, ecologists and wildlife managers have renewed interest in assessing the impact of disease on bat populations in North America. Historically, this assessment has been made by first modeling disease spread, then modeling species occupancy using the estimated disease spread as a covariate in the ecological process. This two-step approach does not acknowledge the joint information shared by the disease and ecological processes and fails to propagate the uncertainty in estimation of the disease process through to the ecological process, resulting in biased estimates of the effect of the disease on the ecological process. We present a framework capable of jointly modeling a spatial disease process and ecological process, allowing for appropriate propagation of uncertainty throughout the model. Using simulation, we show that the joint model results in more precise estimates of disease prevalence and unbiased estimates of the effect of the disease on the ecological process. Our method development is motivated by acoustic data collected in Montana, USA to assess potential impacts of WNS on susceptible bat species. </p>
